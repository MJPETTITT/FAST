									<p>Airbnb takes upfront payment from its online customers and has no inventory; it pays its suppliers (home owners) later (and after subtracting a fee!). So, Airbnb’s WCR is negative. ClubMed’s customers also pay in advance, but will carry some inventory for running its holiday clubs. Hence, its WCR is higher than that of Airbnb. Hilton may have some customers paying in advance, some cash when checking out or with credit cards which typically take some time to transfer the money. So, Hilton will have less upfront funding from its customers. It also will have some inventory, implying altogether a higher WCR.</p>
